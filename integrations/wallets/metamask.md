# Interacting with Moonbeam Using MetaMask

![Intro diagram](/images/integrations/integrations-metamask-banner.png)

## Introduction

Developers can leverage Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features to integrate tools, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), into their DApps. By doing so, they can use the injected library MetaMask provides to interact with the blockchain.

Currently, MetaMask can be configured to connect to two networks: a Moonbeam standalone node or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. 

## Connect MetaMask to Moonbeam

Once you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed, you can connect it to Moonbeam by clicking on the top right logo and opening  the settings.

Here you can configure MetaMask for the following networks:

Moonbeam standalone node:

--8<-- 'metamask-local/network-details.md'

Moonbase Alpha TestNet:

--8<-- 'testnet/metamask-testnet.md'
