# Block Explorers

![Explorer Banner](/images/explorers/explorers-banner.png)

## Introduction 

The Moonbeam team is currently working on onboarding a specialized block explorer solution that would allow users to navigate the EVM as well as the Substrate layer of the blockchain.

Currently, we offer two block explorers: one for the Ethereum API based on the [Expedition explorer](https://github.com/etclabscore/expedition), and one for the Substrate API using [Polkadot JS apps](/integrations/wallets/polkadotjs/). You can use both for either a standalone Moonbeam node or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

!!! note
    If you are using Brave Browser and your explorer is not connecting to the Moonbeam instance you are pointing it to, try disabling Brave Shield.

## Expedition Explorer (Ethereum)

### Local Node

To connect the explorer to a standalone Moonbeam node, you can use [this URL](https://expedition.dev/?rpcUrl=http://127.0.0.1:9933). This uses the RPC endpoint located at port `9933` by default. If you have defined a different port, you can changed it in the URL bar.

!!! note
    Expedition only works if running the standalone Moonbeam node with the repository tag `tutorial-v3`. It will not work if using master.

### Moonbase Alpha

To access the current state of the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, navigate to [https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/). 

The explorer is also available in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Korean.

You can find the repository for the explorer at [this URL](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam-explorer-expedition).

## Polkadot.JS Apps (Substrate)

### Local Node

Polkadot JS Apps uses the WebSocket endpoint to interact with the Network. To connect it to a standalone Moonbeam node, you can follow the steps in [this tutorial](/getting-started/local-node/setting-up-a-node/#connecting-polkadot-js-apps-to-a-local-moonbeam-node). The default port for this is `9944`.

### Moonbase Alpha

To view and interact with the Substrate layer of Moonbase Alpha, go to [this URL](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwss.testnet.moonbeam.network#/explorer). This is the Polkadot JS Apps pointing to the TestNet, you can find more information is [this page](/integrations/wallets/polkadotjs/).
